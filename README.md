# Minecraft-Clone
## About
- This repository contains a very early-highschool attempt at learning low-level OpenGL library functions together with C++
- Concepts used: OpenGL vertex arrays, shaders, buffers, height maps, perlin noise generators, matrix rotations and transformations, etc.
- Features: Infinitely generated random terrain through perlin noise height maps, day-night cycle with color changing sky, player movement and camera rotation, a nasty memory leak which I introduced when testing a new feature.
## Plans
- Fix memory leak and get the project to a more usable state.
- Potentially write V2.0 in the future with newly learned programming concepts from college.
## Status
- Old project. To be fixed.
